# users-crud-test

Implemented parts: users grid, users crud, add/remove permissions
Not implemented: users table controls (sorting, searching, paging)

Full disclousure, I got really rusty with angular part, and it took me more time then I initially planned to spend there.
Unfortunately I was not able to commit to the task for 48h. It took me 2 hours for the service side, and 8-10 hours for the implemented angular part. I'd love to have a chance to discuss further modifications and authentication implementation.
